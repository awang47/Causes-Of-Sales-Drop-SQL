#In order to determine whether the launch date attributed to the sales drop, 
I need to compare ZoomZoom Bat Scooter to other scooter products according to the launch date.
SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_type='scooter'

#To test the hypothesis that the time of year had an impact on sales performance, we require a scooter model to use as the control or reference group. 
I will choose a similar scooter launched at a different time. There are several different options in the product database, each with its own similarities and differences to the experimental
group (ZoomZoom Bat Scooter). The Bat Limited Edition Scooter is suitable for comparison (the control group). It is slightly more expensive, but it was launched only 4 months after the Bat Scooter. Looking at its name, the Bat Limited Edition Scooter seems to share most of the same features, with a number of extras given that it's a "limited edition."

SELECT products.model, sales.sales_transaction_date INTO bat_ltd_sales FROM sales 
      INNER JOIN products ON sales.product_id=products.product_id WHERE sales.product_id=8 ORDER BY sales.sales_transaction_date 
      SELECT * FROM bat_ltd_sales LIMIT 5
      
      
#Now I am going to calculate the total number of sales for Bat Limited Edition.
SELECT COUNT(model) FROM bat_ltd_sales

Bats Limit Edition has 5,803 sales. Bat Scooter sold 7,328.

#So I am creating a count of sales of limited bat edition on a daily basis.
SELECT sales_transaction_date, count(sales_transaction_date) INTO
      bat_ltd_sales_count FROM bat_ltd_sales GROUP BY sales_transaction_date
      ORDER BY sales_transaction_date

SELECT * FROM bat_ltd_sales_count

#Here I need to find out the sum of the daily sales 
SELECT *, sum(count) OVER (ORDER BY sales_transaction_date) INTO
       bat_ltd_sales_growth FROM bat_ltd_sales_count

#Now I need to find out the sales transaction of bat limited edition in the first 3 weeks
SELECT * FROM bat_ltd_sales_growth LIMIT 22

(Sales of the limited-edition scooter did not reach double digits during the first 22 days. The limited edition sold 64 fewer than bat scooter during the first 22 days)

#Here I am going to compute the 7-day lag function for the sum column and insert the results into the bat_ltd_sales_delay table
SELECT *, lag(sum , 7) OVER (ORDER BY sales_transaction_date) INTO
      bat_ltd_sales_delay FROM bat_ltd_sales_growth
      
 #I am going to use the sales growth as a percentage, comparing the current sales volume to that of 1 week prior.
 SELECT *, (sum-lag)/lag AS volume INTO bat_ltd_sales_vol FROM bat_ltd_sales_delay
 SELECT * FROM bat-ltd_sales_vol LIMIT 22
 
Analysis: The sales growth of Bat Limited Edition is more consistent than the original Bat Scooter. 
The growth within the first week is less than that of the original model, but it is selling positively in longer period. 
After 22 days of sales, the sales growth of the Bat Limited Edition scooter is 65% compared to the previous week, 
as compared with the 28% growth identified in the original bat scooter.
